# ðŸ“‰ Myth Busted: Birth Rates After Football Tournaments

This project investigates the widely circulated myth that birth rates increase approximately 9 months after a country performs well in a major football tournament, such as the UEFA European Championship or the FIFA World Cup.

## ðŸ§ª Objective

To test the hypothesis that football success leads to a baby boom, using statistical analysis on birth data before and after international tournaments.

## ðŸ“Š Methodology

1. **Data Collection**  
   - **Birth statistics** were collected from United Nations (UN) data sources and include:
     - **All available monthly birth data per country**, covering a broad time range before and after international football tournaments.
     - Where monthly data was unavailable, **annual birth statistics** were used to maximize country coverage.
   
   - **Tournament data** was also collected, including:
     - Dates of European and World Championship tournaments.
     - Countries that qualified and their performance (e.g. group stage exit, quarter-finals, finals, champions).

   This combined dataset allowed for a comprehensive analysis of birth trends in relation to football tournament performance.

2. **Statistical Tests**
   - A **chi-squared test** was used to check for significant differences in birth counts.
   - A **binomial test** was used to determine whether observed decreases in birth rates were statistically significant.
